## Description

Predictive analytics is the art and science of extracting useful information from historical data and present data for the purpose of predicting future trends. In this course, students will have an introduction to the phases of the analytics lifecycle and gain a basic understanding of a variety of tools and machine learning algorithms to analyze data and discover forward insights. Several techniques will be introduced including: data pre-processing techniques, data reduction algorithms, data clustering algorithms, data classification algorithms, association rules data mining algorithms, recommender systems, and more.

Applications from financial markets, bio-informatics, social networks analytics, and text mining will be covered. Highlights from industrial use cases will be covered to demonstrate how Predictive Analytics relates to improving business performance and impacting better decisions. This is an introductory course that will provide students with basic skills of the new generation of data scientists that will allow them to structure, analyze and derive useful insights from data that could help make better decisions.
