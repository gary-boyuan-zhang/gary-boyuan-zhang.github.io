## Description

The first wave of data science focused on accuracy and efficiency: on what we can do with data.
The second wave is about responsibility: what we should and should not do. Accordingly, this
technical course tackles the issues of ethics and responsibility in data science, including legal
compliance, data quality, algorithmic fairness and diversity, transparency of data and algorithms,
privacy, and data protection.

Data science promises to improve people’s lives, accelerate scientific discovery and innovation,
and bring about positive societal change. Yet, if not used responsibly—in accordance with ethical
and moral norms, and legal and policy considerations—this same technology can cause harm on 
an unprecedented scale. Algorithmic changes in search engines can sway elections and incite
violence; irreproducible results can influence global economic policy; models based on biased
data can legitimize and amplify racist policies in the criminal justice system; algorithmic hiring
practices can silently and scalably violate equal opportunity laws, exposing companies to lawsuits
and reinforcing the feedback loops that lead to lack of diversity, which is both socially undesirable
and can negatively impact performance of organizations. These strategic issues become more
important as the economy globalizes. Therefore, as we develop and deploy data science
methods, we are compelled to think about the effects these methods have on individuals,
population groups, and on society at large.

The European Union recently enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that
mandates legal protections of data subjects on the part of government entities and companies
that employ algorithms and data to make decisions. The US is following suit with a plethora of
local efforts, including a recently passed algorithmic transparency law in New York City that
applies to City agencies. These legal frameworks, and many others that will soon follow, compel
us to develop skills and acquire methodologies for operationalizing responsibility.
