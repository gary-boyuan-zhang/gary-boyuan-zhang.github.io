## Description

Introduction to discrete mathematics with an emphasis on the understanding, composition and critiquing of mathematical proofs.
At the semester's conclusion, the successful student will be able to:

- write clear mathematical statements using standard notation and terminology.
- understand and execute a variety of proof techniques (contradiction, induction, etc.).
- show fluency in the language of basic set theory and Boolean logic.
- understand the basic theorems and their implications in a variety of (discrete) fields including:
  - function theory
  - group theory
  - number theory
  - graph theory


## Topics

Sets, algorithms, induction. Combinatorics. Graphs and trees. Combinatorial circuits. Logic and Boolean algebra.
