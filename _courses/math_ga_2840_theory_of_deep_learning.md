## Description

An overview of the many distinct training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their impact on the function learned by the network. The focus will mostly be on mathematical analysis of deep networks with a large number of neurons. Topics covered: the Neural Tangent Kernel and related dynamics; the spectral bias of DNNs; the transition between lazy and active regimes; the implicit bias of DNNs under the cross-entropy loss or with L2-regularization; Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics; appearance of sparsity for different DNN architectures. 

Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Multi-dimensional analysis (e.g. gradients, Hessians), Probability Theory. Recommended but not required: experience training DNNs, high dimensional probability.
