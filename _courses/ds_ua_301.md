DS-UA 301 Advanced Topics in Data Science:  
Advanced Techniques in Machine Learning and Deep Learning

**Term:** Fall 2022  
**Instructor:** Dr. Parijat Dube  
**Level:** Undergraduate

## Topics

AI revolution, ML concepts, Introduction to ML tooling; Introduction to Deep Learning (DL);

DL Training Tools and Techniques; Special Deep Learning Architectures;
Transfer Learning and Semi-supervised Learning;

Hyperparameter Optimization and Feature Engineering; Automated Machine Learning; Robust Machine Learning;

Distributed Training and Federated Learning; Model drift and Continual learning;


## Description

This course provides a practical introduction to tools and techniques for different stages of
machine learning life-cycle from model development to post-deployment. We will study
techniques for neural network training, hyperparameter optimization, feature engineering, and
neural architecture search. Students will gain knowledge of automated ML tools like auto-
sklearn, auto-WEKA, H20.ai. Beyond model development, the class will be introduced to tools
for creating robust models, explaining model predictions, conducting bias and fairness audits,
detecting post-deployment model drift and continual training. Emphasis will be on getting
working knowledge of tools and techniques through extensive lab work and hands-on
assignments involving standard DL frameworks (Tensorflow, Pytorch) and open-source
technologies.
