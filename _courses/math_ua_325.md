**Term:** Spring 2023  
**Instructor:** Dr. Michal Shavit  
**Level:** Undergraduate

## Topics

The real number system, sequences and series of numbers, functions of a real variable (continuity and differentiability), the Riemann integral, basic topological notions in a metric space, sequences and series of functions including Taylor and Fourier series.

## Description

Introduction to rigorous analysis on the real line.

Topics students should master by the end of the semester:
- Fundamental properties of real numbers
- Convergence of sequences and series
- Elementary topology in metric spaces (open, closed, compact)
- Rigorous definition and first properties of the derivative
- Rigorous definition and first properties of the integral
- Modes of convergence for sequences and series of functions


Skills students should acquire:
- Write routinely short proofs with a good mathematical formalism
- Use the classical tricks in analysis proofs (epsilon/3 argument, construction of a sequence, compactness, diagonal argument)
- Have a good intuition of the various concepts: be able to give typical examples (or counterexamples) for basic statements
- Manipulate rigorously the tools of integral and differential calculus
