## Description

This is an introductory course in stochastic processes. The course covers the theory of
discrete and continuous Markov chains, martingales and Brownian motion and its
generalizations. The discussion of Markov chains includes statistical aspects of these
processes. If time permits, the stochastic integration and the rules of stochastic calculus
are developed. The objective of the course is for you to learn about basic classes of
stochastic processes and their applications.
