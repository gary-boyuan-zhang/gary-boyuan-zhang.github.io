I am a rising senior undergraduate student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), joint majoring in Data Science and Computer Science and double minoring in Mathematics and Business Studies. I am passionate about transforming insight from data and broadly interested in statistical inference, data science, machine learning, and their applications to healthcare, public policy, social science, and sports. 
In particular, I am interested in exploring Causal and Bayesian Inference techniques in observational settings.

Feel free to explore some of my recent [projects](https://gary-boyuan-zhang.github.io/projects/) and [research](https://gary-boyuan-zhang.github.io/research/).
More of my background could be found in [CV](https://gary-boyuan-zhang.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
In addition, I share a strong passion for [teaching](https://gary-boyuan-zhang.github.io/teaching/).

When not working, you might find me running [orienteering]() with a map and a compass in some random forest or park.

<!---
I am dedicated to pursuing a career in researching and transforming knowledge to address real-world problems and support the development of the community and society.

I am planning to conclude my undergraduate study on December 2023, and 

I could be reached at FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME [at] nyu.edu
