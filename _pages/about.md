Hi! My name is Boyuan Zhang (张博源). I am a third-year undergraduate student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) joint majoring in Data Science and Computer Science and double minoring in Mathematics and Business Studies. I am passionate about transforming insight from data and broadly interested in statistical data science, statistical inference, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in the social science and sports contexts. I dedicate to pursuing a career of researching and transforming knowledge at the intersection of statistics and data science and to apply on real-world problems.

As of now, I anticipate concluding my undergraduate study on December 2023, and I am looking forward to pursuing graduate studies in the field of statistics, data science, and machine learning starting in fall 2024!
