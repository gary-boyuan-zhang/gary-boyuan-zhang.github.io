My research mainly focuses on discovering and exploiting causality in observational data. In particular, I'm interested in: 
1. developing causal discovery and inference techniques by incorporating both parametric and nonparametric methods,
2. empowering ML models with learning causal representation, and
3. applications in healthcare, public policy, social science, and sports.
