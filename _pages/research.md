My research mainly focuses on discovering and exploiting causality in observational data. In particular, I'm interested in: 
1. developing causal discovery and inference techniques to reveal causal structures in observational data,
2. empowering ML models with learning causal representation to enhance robustness, and
3. applications in healthcare, public policy, social science, and sports.
